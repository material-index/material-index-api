- High-entropy strings that could be secrets
- JWT tokens and API keys
- Database connection strings
- Environment variables with sensitive data

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Git Configuration
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Pre-commit hooks to prevent secret commits
- Repository scanning for exposed secrets

### File Exclusions
The following patterns are automatically excluded:
```
# Environment variables
.env*
*.env

# Secrets and credentials

## 🚨 Incident Response

If you discover a security vulnerability or exposed secret:

1. **Immediate Action**: Contact security team immediately
2. **Do Not**: Create public issues or discussions
3. **Report**: Use private channels for security reports
4. **Revoke**: Immediately revoke any exposed credentials
5. **Rotate**: Change all potentially compromised secrets

## 📧 Security Contact

For security-related issues:
- **Email**: security@material-index.com
- **Private**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Urgent**: Contact via secure channels for critical issues

## 🔄 Secret Rotation

All secrets should be rotated regularly:
- **API Keys**: Every 90 days
- **Database Credentials**: Every 180 days
- **JWT Secrets**: Every 365 days
- **Service Tokens**: As needed based on usage

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before committing code:
- [ ] No `.env` files included
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No API keys in code or comments
- [ ] No database connection strings
- [ ] No JWT tokens or secrets
- [ ] No private keys or certificates
- [ ] All sensitive data in environment variables
- [ ] Configuration files use templates only

## 🏆 Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for all secrets
2. **Template Files**: Use `.example` or `.template` files for configuration
3. **Secret Management**: Use proper secret management tools
4. **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive information
5. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit for exposed secrets
6. **Education**: Train team members on security practices
